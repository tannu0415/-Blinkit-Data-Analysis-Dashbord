Total Sales Performance – Measure overall revenue and sales distribution.

Item Analysis – Identify top-performing and least-performing product categories.

Outlet Insights – Compare sales performance across different outlet sizes, locations, and establishment years.

Customer Trends – Understand customer preferences through item ratings and visibility.
